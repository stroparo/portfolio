# Portfolio Back-End

This project implements a CRUD API to store information about a portfolio's repositories with title, url and technologies for each.

As this is just a sample it is simplified and information is stored only in memory (JavaScript array) as of this commit.

This is an implementation to fullfil the second challenge of the GoStack 12th edition by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), a major software development bootcamp in Brazil. This challenge is defined in level 1 of the bootcamp.

## Requirements

* Node v12.x.x
* Yarn 1.x.x

## Development Environment Setup

Clone this repository, enter its directory and execute this command in the shell/terminal:

```bash
yarn
```

### Hot Reload

Execute this command in the shell/terminal:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will invoke nodemon which will start node and keep restarting it upon each saved file change.

### Testing

Execute the 'test' script to perform an automated test round by executing this command in the shell/terminal:

```bash
yarn test
```

Following the bootcamp's FAQ, these are the same tests the bootcamp's automated correction applies to evaluate the final submission.
